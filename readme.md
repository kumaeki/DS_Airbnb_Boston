# Exploring the Boston Airbnb data

I will try to feagure out how the features(month in a year, host area or property type, etc) affect the price , and try to predict the price via          LinearRegression(sklearn)


you could find the dataset in the url <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/boston>

There are three data files in the Boston dataset, but this time I just use two files as follow:

- Listings, including full descriptions and average review score
- Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day
